class ocf_mesos::secrets {
  # The way we manage secrets in Mesos is that we put them in the Puppet
  # private share under "docker", which is made available to the Mesos agents
  # via a special file share, "private-docker".
  #
  # We then mount individual directories (e.g. for the RT service, we might
  # mount /opt/share/docker/secrets/rt into the container).
  #
  # Since inside the container, our processes typically run as "nobody" (or
  # another unprivileged user), these secrets need to be world-readable.
  # That's fine inside Docker, but outside Docker, we don't want random users
  # on the host to be able to access them. So we make one directory,
  # `/opt/share/docker`, which has strict permissions, and then put the secrets
  # in `/opt/share/docker/secrets` underneath it.
  #
  # The extra directory is theoretically unnecessary, but in practice Puppet
  # makes it hard to set "0700" on a directory, while recursively setting
  # 0644/0755 on children. Oh well.
  #
  # Only some Mesos agents have this class. Some (e.g. desktops) don't, and so
  # won't run jobs that require secrets. All masters have the class.
